# VISUALIZATION OF BIRD STRIKES

_BIRD STRIKES ANALYSIS - UM2_

 -> **Problem statement**
 Transport and communication are vital in analytics. Environmental impacts and safety concerns are significant, given the rise in vehicles and urbanization. Technologies and AI, particularly MAS, offer solutions to these challenges.

  A bird strike is a collision between a bird and an aircraft, often occurring during take-off, climb, approach, and landing. These incidents pose serious risks, especially to jet-engine aircraft.

 **Tools used:** Power BI Python MS Excel

 -> **Learnt things from this Project**
 
i) Learned how to create a new visualization (Calendar visualization) using matrix tables which can be used for various analytical purposes.

ii) Learned how to use bookmarks and selectors for different purposes.

iii) Tried using a color palette and stuck to that color throughout the dashboard.

-> **Some Important insights from the Dashboard**

- 42.72% of incidents involved prior pilot warning. Prior warnings reduce aircraft damage risk. 52.78% of incidents involved small unknown birds. 72.9% of incidents involved a single bird/wildlife, causing damage. 90.31% of incidents caused no damage; 9.69% caused damage
